# Scribble_Saliency (CVPR2020)
Weakly-Supervised Salient Object Detection via Scribble Annotations

# Dataset
We manually labeled the benchmark saliency dataset DUTS with scribble, and provided three versions of scribble annotations with thin scribbles and wider scribbles:

1) thin scribbles:

2) wider scribbles:

We also labeled the fixation prediction dataset Salicon (the 10K training training dataset) with scribble for further research on weakly supervised salient object detection and fully supervised fixation prediction.

3) scribble labeling of Salicon training dataset:
